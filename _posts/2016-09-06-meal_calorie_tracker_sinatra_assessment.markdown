--------------------


My first real web application, from conception to completion. It is pretty amazing to me that just a couple of months ago, I was more or less clueless on how to program, much less take code and make it into and application that people could actually use. While, it's not not the next slack or anything, it is my first!

First coming up with an idea, I wanted something relatively basic but at least a little useful. It seemed to me that a calorie tracker would work and as a bonus, it is something that I've never used myself or probably ever would.. But I'm sure there are plenty of health conscious people out there that would want something like this.

The next step, planning how you want the application to work. What will people see and how will they interact with it. I sort of skipped this section, I figured I'd just decide on the objects, associations and start coding the crud for each object. I completed most of the project, then while trying to set up the editing portion of the crud I realized that my associations didn't really work the way I wanted them to. I then realized that I had routes and views that weren't needed for my particular project.. Overall it was a bunch of code that wasn't really designed as any particular app.. 

I decided to start over. I at least has several helper methods I liked and some routes and views that I would keep in one form or another. This time I decided I would start with how I wanted the user to see and interact with my app. I also considered how I wanted the objects (meals, days) to interact in the crud. This helped me decide on my new object association structure, and in turn made the whole 2nd round of coding much smoother.

I think my biggest take-aways from this project, was to plan out my applications first, then start coding. Otherwise, you end up with a messy code base and a lot of wasted time.
