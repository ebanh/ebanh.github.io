I really love coding. It has to be one of the most creative, fascinating, challenging and frustrating activity I've done. Once I start on a lab or project, time just passes without notice and it's wonderful. Sometimes my motivation can waiver or just vanish on non-lab lessons, where the text is long and ever-scrolling... especially after a long day at work.

Sometimes you get home and you really just want to relax infront of the tv, have a drink, play a video game or some combination of the above. There is actually another activity I can relax (mostly) to, and that is coding. Unfortunately reading that next lesson, isn't always one of them. I do enjoy learning, otherwise I wouldn't be here, but sometimes the brain just needs a break. 

So how do you keep motivated? I often find myself losing focus, getting distracted and I need to refocus. This is something I continue to struggle with, as I've always been easily distracted, especially in learning environments. Currently, when i just can't stay focused, I take breaks doing some of my above activites. I find it helps to let the brain escape for a bit and then refocus. Other times, it just marks the end of my learning day.

Luckily one of the few activities that I rarely get distracted from is coding.

Now... back to that lesson!
